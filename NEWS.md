# measr (development version)

* Updated reliability functionality to allow for the calculation of accuracy and consistency with different thresholds for determining attribute classifications.

* Added new `measrfit()` function for creating measrfit objects from *Stan* models that were not originally created with measr.

* Added `aic()` and `bic()` functions for calculating the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, respectively, for models estimated with `method = "optim"`.

* Refactored package to use S7 objects instead of S3.

* Functions for generating Stan code have been relocated to dcmstan.

* `measr_dcm()` deprecated in favor of `dcm_estimate()`.

* New functionality for relative model fit comparisons (`aic()`, `bic()`, `bayes_factor()`).

* New functionality for testing model assumptions (`yens_q3()`).

# measr 1.0.0

## New documentation

* A new article on model evaluation has been added to the project website (https://measr.info).

* The model estimation article has been updated to use the same (simulated) data set as the model evaluation article.

* More detailed installation instructions have been added to the getting started vignette (#23).

* A case study demonstrating a full DCM-based analysis using data from the ECPE (`?ecpe_data`) has been added to the project website.

## Minor improvements and fixes

* Fixed bug in the LCDM specification of constraints for level-3 and above interaction terms.

* Functions for evaluating estimated models (e.g., `fit_ppmc()`, `reliability()`) no longer recalculate indices if they have previously been saved to the model object. This behavior can be overwritten with `force = TRUE`.

* Updated *Stan* syntax to be compatible with the new array syntax (@andrjohns, #36)

* `get_parameters()` now preserves item identifiers by default. Items can be renamed with numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...) by setting `rename_item = TRUE`.

* measr now reexports functions from [posterior](https://mc-stan.org/posterior/) for conducting mathematical operations on `posterior::rvar()` objects.

* Respondent estimates are now returned as `posterior::rvar()` objects when not summarized.

# measr 0.3.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

## New features

* Support for additional model specifications has been added (#10):
  * The compensatory reparameterized unified model (C-RUM) can now be estimated by defining `type = "crum"` in the `measr_dcm()` function.
  * Users can now drop higher order interactions from the loglinear cognitive diagnostic model (LCDM). A new argument for `measr_dcm()`, `max_interaction`, defines the highest order interactions to estimate. For example, `max_interaction = 2` will estimate only intercepts, main effects, and two-way interactions.
  * A new argument to `measr_dcm()`, `attribute_structure` allows users to specified either "unconstrained" relationships between attributes or "independent" attributes.

* Updated prior specifications:
  * Users can now specify a prior distribution for the structural parameters that govern the base rates of class membership (#2).
  * Safeguards were added to warn users when a specified prior is not defined for the chosen DCM sub-type. For example, an error is generated if a prior is defined for a slipping parameter, but the LCDM was chosen as the type of model to be estimated (#1).

## Minor improvements and fixes

* Fixed bug with `backend = "rstan"` where warmup iterations could be more than the total iterations requested by the user if warmup iterations were not also specified (#6).

* Additional specifications were added to `measr_extract()` for extracting results from an estimated model.
