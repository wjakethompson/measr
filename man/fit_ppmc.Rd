\usage{
fit_ppmc(
  x,
  ...,
  model_fit = NULL,
  item_fit = NULL,
  ndraws = NULL,
  probs = c(0.025, 0.975),
  return_draws = 0,
  force = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An estimated model object (e.g., from \code{\link[=dcm_estimate]{dcm_estimate()}}).}

\item{...}{Unused. For future extensions.}

\item{model_fit}{The posterior predictive model checks to compute for an
evaluation of model-level fit. If \code{NULL}, no model-level checks are
computed. See details.}

\item{item_fit}{The posterior predictive model checks to compute for an
evaluation of item-level fit. If \code{NULL}, no item-level checks are computed.
See details.}

\item{ndraws}{The number of posterior draws to base the checks on. Must be
less than or equal to the total number of posterior draws retained in the
estimated model. If \code{NULL} (the default) the total number from the
estimated model is used.}

\item{probs}{The percentiles to be computed by the \code{\link[stats:quantile]{stats::quantile()}}
function for summarizing the posterior distribution for each fit statistic.}

\item{return_draws}{Number of posterior draws for each specified fit
statistic to be returned. This does not affect the calculation of the
posterior predictive checks, but can be useful for visualizing the fit
statistics. Must be less than \code{ndraws} (or the total number of draws if
\code{ndraws = NULL}). If \code{0} (the default), only summaries of the posterior are
returned (no individual samples).}

\item{force}{If all requested \acronym{PPMC}s have already been added to the
model object using \code{\link[=add_fit]{add_fit()}}, should they be recalculated. Default is
\code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements, "model_fit" and "item_fit". If either
\code{model_fit = NULL} or \code{item_fit = NULL} in the function call, this will be
a one-element list, with the null criteria excluded. Each list element, is
itself a list with one element for each specified \acronym{PPMC} containing
a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble}. For example if
\code{item_fit = c("conditional_prob", "odds_ratio")}, the "item_fit" element
will be a list of length two, where each element is a tibble containing the
results of the \acronym{PPMC}. All tibbles follow the same general
structure:

\itemize{
\item \verb{obs_\{ppmc\}}: The value of the relevant statistic in the observed
data.
\item \code{ppmc_mean}: The mean of the \code{ndraws} posterior samples calculated
for the given statistic.
\item Quantile columns: 1 column for each value of \code{probs}, providing the
corresponding quantiles of the \code{ndraws} posterior samples calculated for
the given statistic.
\item \code{samples}: A list column, where each element contains a vector of
length \code{return_draws}, representing samples from the posterior
distribution of the calculated statistic. This column is excluded if
\code{return_draws = 0}.
\item \code{ppp}: The posterior predictive p-value. This is the proportion of
posterior samples for calculated statistic that are greater than the
observed value. Values very close to 0 or 1 indicate incompatibility
between the fitted model and the observed data.
}
}
\description{
For models estimated with \code{method = "mcmc"}, use the posterior distributions
to compute expected distributions for fit statistics and compare to values
in the observed data.
}
\details{
Posterior predictive model checks (PPMCs) use the posterior distribution of
an estimated model to compute different statistics. This creates an expected
distribution of the given statistic, \emph{if our estimated parameters are
correct}. We then compute the statistic in our observed data and compare the
observed value to the expected distribution. Observed values that fall
outside of the expected distributions indicate incompatibility between the
estimated model and the observed data.

For DCMs, we currently support PPMCs at the model and item level. At the
model level, we calculate the expected raw score distribution
(\code{model_fit = "raw_score"}) as described by Thompson (2019) and Park et al.
(2015). At the item level, we can calculate the conditional probability that
a respondent in each class provides a correct response (\code{item_fit = "conditional_prob"}) as described by Thompson (2019) and Sinharay & Almond
(2007) or the overall proportion correct for an item (\code{item_fit = "pvalue"}),
as described by Thompson (2019). We can also calculate the odds ratio for
each pair of items (\code{item_fit = "odds_ratio"}) as described by Park et al.
(2015) and Sinharay et al. (2006).
