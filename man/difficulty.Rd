\usage{
difficulty(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The estimated model to be evaluated.}
}
\value{
A list with one element:
\itemize{
\item \code{weighted_pvalue}: A \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} with one row
per item containing the weighted p-value for the item.
}
}
\description{
The item difficulty index is a measure of the difficulty of an item, often
represented as a proportion correct index or p-value (de la Torre & Douglas,
2008). Diagnostic classification models define p-values conditioned on latent
class, which provide class-level information (Thompson, 2019). The item-level
weighted p-value is a weighted average of class-level p-values, and defines
the likelihood that a randomly selected respondent correctly answers an item.
}
\details{
The item-level weighted p-value discrimination is calculated as the
average of class-level p-values (i.e. \eqn{\pi_{ic}}), weighted by the
relative frequency of each latent class (i.e. \eqn{\nu_c}).
