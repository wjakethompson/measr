# measr: Bayesian Psychometric Measurement Using 'Stan'

Estimate diagnostic classification models (also called cognitive
diagnostic models) with 'Stan'. Diagnostic classification models are
confirmatory latent class models, as described by Rupp et al. (2010,
ISBN: 978-1-60623-527-0). Automatically generate 'Stan' code for the
general loglinear cognitive diagnostic diagnostic model proposed by
Henson et al. (2009)
[doi:10.1007/s11336-008-9089-5](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-008-9089-5)
and other subtypes that introduce additional model constraints. Using
the generated 'Stan' code, estimate the model evaluate the model's
performance using model fit indices, information criteria, and
reliability metrics.
